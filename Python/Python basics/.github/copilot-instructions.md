# Copilot Instructions - Python Basics

## Project Overview
This is a Python learning repository focused on fundamental programming concepts. The project uses **Jupyter Notebooks** for interactive, educational code execution with narrative documentation.

## Project Structure
- **Root**: Contains lesson notebooks following the naming pattern `NN_Topic.ipynb` (e.g., `01_Hello_World.ipynb`)
- Single-notebook structure suitable for incremental expansion as new topics are added

## Key Patterns & Conventions

### Notebook Format
- Educational focus: Each notebook teaches a specific Python concept
- Interactive learning: Combine markdown explanations with executable Python cells
- Progressive naming: Use numbered prefix (01, 02, 03...) for logical topic progression

### Code Style
- Entry-level Python: Focus on clarity and fundamentals over advanced patterns
- Simple, commented examples suitable for beginners
- Single concepts per notebook for focused learning

## Running & Testing
- Open any `.ipynb` file in VS Code with the Jupyter extension
- Execute cells individually using the **Run Cell** button or `Shift+Enter`
- Output appears inline below each cell

## Recommended AI Agent Guidelines
- Prioritize **clarity** over conciseness when explaining concepts
- Add **comments** to code examples explaining the "why" behind syntax
- Suggest progressive exercises: start simple, gradually introduce complexity
- Preserve interactive Jupyter cell structure - don't convert to standalone scripts
- When adding new lessons, follow the numbered naming convention
