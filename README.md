# 📚 My Learning Path — Data & Analytics Journey

Hi! 👋  
Welcome to my personal learning repository — a structured place where I **review fundamentals**, **learn new tools**, and **build practical skills** to prepare for roles such as:

- 📊 **Data Analyst**
- 🧠 **Data Scientist**
- 💼 **Business Analyst**

This repo is my “knowledge gym” 🏋️ — I keep notes, exercises, and small projects to track progress and stay consistent.

✅ **Notes & summaries** of key topics  
✅ **Hands-on exercises** and experiments  
✅ **Mini-projects** and reusable snippets
